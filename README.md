# Sketch-Synthesis-Using-GAN
In criminal investigation, face sketch is the main approach to search out suspects, especially in many cases when facial attribute descriptions of suspects by witnesses are available. The paper proposes a model to generate sketches from the given facial attribute text which is provided by the witness as an input source. It generates sketches by translating the text in the form of human described facial attribute text to the desired outcome. Problems arise in synthesizing high quality face sketches due to ambiguity and complexity of description of facial attributes. In this paper we propose a facial sketch synthesis approach using Generative Adversarial Network. Our contributions lie in two aspects: 1) we construct a text to face sketch database (T2S). The database, namely T2S dataset, is annotated with CUFSF dataset of 1194 sketches with originally labelled data; 2) we synthesize detailed face sketches using GAN.
